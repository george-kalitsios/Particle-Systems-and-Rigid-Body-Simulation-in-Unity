PART_A

Particles that are constantly created from a specific position with random initial velocity.

Collision detection and Collision Response (collision: transparent (invisible) cube surrounding particle system with a damping factor)
PART_B

Same as PART_A but also: Objects (2 spheres) in a fixed position in space that act attrack force |Fr| = kr / dist^2
PART_C

Particles (specific number) that are initially in a specific position Repulsive forces (among particles) proportional to their distance. The particles are inside a transparent sphere: Collision Detection, Collision Response
PART_D

Bird Flocking (Alignement+Cohesion+Seperation)
PART_E

Simple Scene.
